Here is the live website: [https://ayoayco.github.io/blog](https://ayoayco.github.io/blog)

This is a blog built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator in Ruby, which I customized on top of the default [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Customizations are mostly inspired by the [Jekyll website itself](https://jekyllrb.com). :)

Later, I will do a fork of Minima theme and publish my customizations.
